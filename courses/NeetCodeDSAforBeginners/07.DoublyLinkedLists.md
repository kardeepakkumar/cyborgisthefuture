# Doubly Linked Lists

- We have 2 pointers: next and previous
- previous node connects to the previous node in the linked list
- for the first node, head.prev = null, like tail.next = null
- Inserting new node at end, similar to singly linked list:
  - tail.next = NewNode
  - NewNode.prev = tail
  - tail = tail.next
- Adding new node at start:
  - head.prev = NewNode
  - NewNode.next = head
  - head = head.prev
- Removing a node - we can get prev node immediately
- Removing last element:
  - tail.prev.next = null
  - tail = tail.prev
- Removing first element:
  - head.next.prev = null
  - head = head.next
- Removing a node in the middle:
  - curr.prev.next = curr.next
  - curr.next.prev = curr.prev
- Inserting/Removing is O(1)
- Searching is still O(n)
- Stacks can be implemented with linked lists, but not done commonly
