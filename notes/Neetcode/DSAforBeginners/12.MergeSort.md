# Merge Sort

- One of the most commonly used sort algorithms
- Pretty efficient
- Split into 2 equal halves, until you have 1 element
- Merge 2 sorted halves into 1 sorted list
- Divide and conquer
- O(nlogn) time
- O(n) space
- Implemented using 2 branch recursion
- Pseudo code of merge sort is as follows
```python
def mergeSort(arr):
   if len(arr) <= 1:
       return arr
   mid = len(arr) // 2
   left = arr[:mid]
   right = arr[mid:]
   left = mergeSort(left)
   right = mergeSort(right)
   return merge(left, right)
def merge(left, right)
   arr = []
   while len(left) > 0 and len(right) > 0:
       if left[0] < right[0]:
           arr.append(left.pop(0))
       else:
           arr.append(right.pop(0))
   return arr + left + right
```
-    Better implementation by passing starting and ending indices instead of elements
-    Merge sort can be implemented stably
