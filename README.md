# Tech Notes Repository

Welcome to my Tech Notes Repository! This space is dedicated to sharing my journey through the world of technology, focusing on the challenges I tackle, the solutions I discover, and the knowledge I gain along the way.

## Current Contents

- **LeetCode Solutions:** A comprehensive collection of my solutions to various coding challenges on LeetCode. Each solution is accompanied by Time-Space Complexity analysis.

## How to Navigate

- **LeetCode Solutions:** Found in the `/leetcode` directory, solutions are tagged with difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and relevant topics (sets, dictionaries, recursion, etc.) for easy navigation.

## Contribution

I'm always looking to improve and expand this repository. If you have suggestions, corrections, or questions about any of the solutions or topics covered, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Future Plans

While the repository currently focuses on LeetCode solutions, I plan to include:

- Notes on various tech topics, such as AI, software development, system design, and more.
- Tutorials and project walkthroughs.
- Reviews and summaries of tech books and courses.

Stay tuned for updates and new content!
